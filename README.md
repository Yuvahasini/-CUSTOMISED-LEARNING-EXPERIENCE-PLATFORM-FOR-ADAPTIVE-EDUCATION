# -CUSTOMISED-LEARNING-EXPERIENCE-PLATFORM-FOR-ADAPTIVE-EDUCATION

Problem Statement

This project implements an adaptive learning platform that personalizes learning paths for students based on their performance, pace, and understanding. The system ensures students move forward only after completing prerequisite topics, making learning more effective and inclusive.

Objective

Personalize learning for each student

Adapt content dynamically based on progress

Ensure prerequisite-based topic progression

Improve engagement using efficient data structures

Motivation

Traditional one-size-fits-all education does not suit all learners. This platform addresses individual learning needs, improves motivation, and supports self-paced, customized education.

Data Structures Used & Purpose

Graph: Represents topic dependencies and prerequisites

Trie: Fast storage and retrieval of learning topics

HashMap: Efficient student data management

Min-Heap: Priority-based learning recommendations

Queue: Sequential task handling

Array: Tracks completed topics and progress

Time Complexity

Graph: O(V + E)

Trie: O(m)

HashMap: O(1)

Min-Heap: O(log n)

Queue: O(n)

Array: O(n)

Key Features

Adaptive learning paths

Personalized task recommendations

Prerequisite-aware topic flow

Efficient progress tracking

Conclusion

The project demonstrates how core Data Structures and Algorithms can be applied to build an effective adaptive learning system that enhances personalization and learning outcomes.
